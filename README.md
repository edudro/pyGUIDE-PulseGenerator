# Pulse Train Generator and GUI Application

This repository contains the code for a Pulse Train Generator using PyDAQmx and a GUI application built with PyQt5. The project aims to provide a user-friendly interface to control pulse train generation for applications in neurorehabilitation, motor learning, and related fields.

## Repository Contents

- `PulseTrainGenerator.py`: This script defines the `ContinuousPulseTrainGeneration` class to create a continuous pulse train using the National Instruments DAQmx driver. It allows starting, stopping, and configuring the pulse train with specific frequency and duty cycle.
- `pyGuide.py`: This script is the main entry point for the PyQt5 GUI application. It sets up the UI, connects UI elements with their functionalities, and handles user interactions.
- `pyGuide.ui`: XML description file for the UI, generated by the PyQt5 UI code generator.

## Features

- **Continuous Pulse Train Generation**: Generate a continuous pulse train with configurable frequency and duty cycle.
- **GUI Application**: Control the pulse train generation through a user-friendly interface.
